Few things are as damaging to relationships as a lack of forgiveness. But when you've been hurt by someone, how do you know if you should forgive them or not? Is it just when they say "sorry?" What about when they're not? Does someone ever not deserve your forgiveness? In this message (part 4 of a [series][0] at [Epikos][1] church), we explore time-tested principles of forgiveness for anyone who has been hurt by someone who has wronged them. No matter the situation, these are 4 rules of forgiveness every relationship should follow.
